# Transaction Management Module Instructions

## Overview
The `/dorm/transactions` route provides a comprehensive view of all financial transactions in the dormitory system. Its primary functions are:

1. **Transaction History**: Display a comprehensive list of all payments with their status, method, and receipt details
2. **Balance Tracking**: Monitor payment status and transaction history for each tenant
3. **Receipt Management**: View and download payment receipts
4. **Transaction Analysis**: Filter and analyze transaction data

This route works closely with the payments module to provide a clear view of all financial transactions and maintain accurate records.
