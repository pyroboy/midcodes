## Test Architecture Features

### ðŸ”§ **Comprehensive Test Data Management**
- Uses `testDataManager.createMinimalTestData()` for consistent test setup
- Automatic cleanup with `testDataManager.cleanupAll()`
- Organization-scoped test isolation

### ðŸ”§ **Real Workflow Integration**
- Tests actual card generation processes (not just credit functions)
- Simulates complete user journeys from credit check to card creation
- Includes metadata tracking and audit trails

### ðŸ”§ **Advanced Scenarios**
- Multi-credit deductions for complex features
- Credit exhaustion and fallback scenarios  
- Premium feature discounts and bonuses
- Batch operation edge cases

### ðŸ”§ **UI State Testing**
- Dynamic UI calculations based on credit status
- Real-time state updates when user permissions change
- Feature visibility and accessibility testing

## Key Test Innovations

### **Multi-Credit Deduction Simulation**
```typescript
// Simulate multi-credit deduction for complex cards
let deductionSuccess = true;
for (let i = 0; i < template.creditCost; i++) {
  const result = await deductCardGenerationCredit(
    profile.id, profile.org_id, 
    `${template.name}-deduction-${i + 1}`
  );
  if (!result.success) {
    deductionSuccess = false;
    break;
  }
}
```

### **Quality Fallback Logic**
```typescript
// Should fall back to lower resolution
const affordableQuality = availableCredits >= highResolutionCost ? 'ultra' : 
                         availableCredits >= 2 ? 'high' : 'standard';
```

### **Premium Feature Integration**
```typescript
// Premium users get quality enhancements
const actualCreditCost = isPremiumUser ? 
  Math.floor(quality.creditCost * 0.8) : quality.creditCost;
```

## Validation Results

### **Credit System Integration**
- âœ… All credit operations properly integrated with actual features
- âœ… Transaction logging works correctly for complex operations
- âœ… Credit balance tracking accurate across all scenarios
- âœ… Premium feature bypasses function correctly

### **Real-World Workflow Coverage**
- âœ… Complete card generation workflow tested
- âœ… Template creation process with credit validation
- âœ… Batch operations with mixed billing
- âœ… Quality and resolution selection with credit requirements

### **UI State Consistency**
