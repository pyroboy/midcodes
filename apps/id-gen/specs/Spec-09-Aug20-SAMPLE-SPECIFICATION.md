# Sample Specification

## Overview
This is a sample specification file created to test the MD file creation and mirroring workflow for specifications.

## Classification
**Type**: SPECIFICATION (Instructions/Plans)
**Category**: Implementation plan/instruction document
**Created**: August 20, 2025
**Spec Number**: 09

## Purpose
This specification demonstrates the proper workflow for creating specification files that contain:
- Implementation plans
- Technical instructions
- "How to" content
- Step-by-step guidance

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Setup
1. Create specification file in `/specs/` folder
2. Use naming convention: `Spec-NN-MMMDD-Title-With-Dashes.md`
3. Determine correct sequence number from existing files

### Phase 2: Content Creation
1. Write clear implementation instructions
2. Include step-by-step procedures
3. Define technical requirements
4. Specify expected outcomes

### Phase 3: Mirroring
1. Mirror to vault `repo-specs/` folder
2. Maintain same filename in both locations
3. Ensure synchronization between repository and vault

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Created in correct repository location: `/specs/Spec-09-Aug20-SAMPLE-SPECIFICATION.md`
- ⏳ Pending vault mirror synchronization
- ⏳ Pending workflow validation

## Technical Requirements
- Must follow `Spec-NN-MMMDD-Title-With-Dashes.md` naming pattern
- Must be placed in `/specs/` directory
- Must be mirrored to vault `repo-specs/` folder
- Must maintain consistency between both locations

## Notes
This sample demonstrates the established workflow for specification files that contain plans, instructions, implementation guidelines, or "how-to" content.
