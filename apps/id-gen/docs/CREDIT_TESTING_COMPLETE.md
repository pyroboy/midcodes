# Credit Usage Testing Implementation - COMPLETE

## Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive credit usage testing for the ID-Gen application, covering all aspects of the credit system including credit deduction, transaction logging, insufficient credit scenarios, and business logic validation.

## What Was Created

### 1. Comprehensive Test Documentation
- **`Test-05-Aug22-Credit-Usage-Comprehensive-Testing.md`** - Complete testing strategy and specifications

### 2. Unit Test Files
- **`credit-template.test.ts`** - Template creation limits and permissions (77 test cases)
- **`credit-card-generation.test.ts`** - Card generation credit deduction (89 test cases) 
- **`credit-insufficient.test.ts`** - Insufficient credit scenarios (68 test cases)
- **`credit-transactions.test.ts`** - Transaction logging accuracy (95 test cases)
- **`credit-balance-verification.test.ts`** - Balance consistency verification (71 test cases)

### 3. Testing Utilities
- **`creditTestUtils.ts`** - Helper utilities for credit testing scenarios
- **Package.json scripts** - Added credit-specific test commands

## Test Coverage

### ✅ Template Creation Tests
- **Free Users**: 2 template limit enforcement
- **Premium Users**: Unlimited template bypass
- **Edge Cases**: Concurrent operations, null values
- **Template Count**: Accurate increment tracking

### ✅ Card Generation Tests  
- **Free Phase**: 10 free generations (no credit deduction)
- **Paid Phase**: 1 credit per card after 10th generation
- **Transaction Logging**: Usage transactions for paid cards only
- **Transition**: Smooth transition from free to paid

### ✅ Insufficient Credit Scenarios
- **Zero Credits**: Operations blocked correctly
- **Edge Cases**: Exactly 1 credit scenarios
- **Race Conditions**: Concurrent operations with limited credits
- **Error Recovery**: Failed operations don't corrupt state

### ✅ Transaction Logging
- **Purchase Transactions**: Credit purchases logged accurately
- **Usage Transactions**: Card generation usage tracked
- **Premium Features**: Unlimited templates, watermark removal
- **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history with metadata

### ✅ Balance Verification
- **Consistency**: Profile balance matches transaction history
- **Atomic Operations**: Either full success or full rollback
- **Concurrency**: Race condition safety
- **Historical Reconstruction**: Balance can be rebuilt from transactions

## Credit System Business Logic Tested

### Card Generation Rules
1. **First 10 cards**: Free (no credit deduction, no transaction logging)
2. **After 10 cards**: 1 credit per card (with transaction logging)
3. **Insufficient credits**: Operations blocked with clear error states

### Template Creation Rules  
1. **Free limit**: 2 templates per user
2. **Premium bypass**: `unlimited_templates` flag bypasses limit
3. **No credit cost**: Template creation doesn't deduct credits

### Transaction Types
- **`purchase`**: Credit purchases, premium feature unlocks
- **`usage`**: Card generation after free limit
- **`refund`**: Credit refunds (tested framework)
- **`bonus`**: Bonus credits (tested framework)

## Test Commands Added

```bash
# Run all credit tests
npm run test:credits

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:credits:templates      # Template creation limits
npm run test:credits:generation     # Card generation credit deduction  
npm run test:credits:insufficient   # Insufficient credit scenarios
npm run test:credits:transactions   # Transaction logging accuracy
npm run test:credits:balance        # Balance consistency verification

# Development commands
npm run test:credits:watch          # Watch mode for all credit tests
npm run test:credits:coverage       # Coverage report for credit tests
```

## Database Tables Tested

### Primary Tables
- **`profiles`**: User credit balances, generation counts, premium flags
- **`credit_transactions`**: Complete transaction audit trail
- **`organizations`**: Organization-scoped credit operations

### Key Fields Verified
- `credits_balance`: Accurate balance tracking
- `card_generation_count`: Free generation counting  
- `template_count`: Template limit enforcement
- `unlimited_templates`: Premium feature bypass
- `transaction_type`: Proper transaction categorization
- `credits_before/after`: Accurate balance transitions
