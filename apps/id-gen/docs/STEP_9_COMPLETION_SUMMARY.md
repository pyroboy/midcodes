# Step 9 Completion Summary

## Task: Keep existing credit system intact; avoid touching client utilities

✅ **COMPLETED**: The existing credit system has been preserved while ensuring purchase UI calls the payment remote functions.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Preserved Existing Credit System (`src/lib/utils/credits.ts`)**

- ❌ **NO CHANGES** made to `apps/id-gen/src/lib/utils/credits.ts` as required
- All existing credit checking/using logic remains intact:
  - `getUserCredits()` - Get current user credit information
  - `canCreateTemplate()` - Check template creation limits
  - `canGenerateCard()` - Check card generation availability
  - `deductCardGenerationCredit()` - Deduct credits for card generation
  - `addCredits()` - Add credits from purchases (server-side only)
  - `grantUnlimitedTemplates()` - Grant premium features (server-side only)
  - `grantWatermarkRemoval()` - Grant premium features (server-side only)
  - `incrementTemplateCount()` - Track template usage
  - `getCreditHistory()` - Retrieve transaction history

### 2. **Updated Purchase UI to Use Payment Remote Functions**

#### **Modified: `src/routes/pricing/+page.svelte`**

- **Before**: Used direct API calls to `/api/payments/create-credit-payment` and `/api/payments/create-feature-payment`
- **After**: Uses payment remote functions:
  - `createCreditPayment()` from `$lib/server/remotes/payments.remote`
  - `createFeaturePayment()` from `$lib/server/remotes/payments.remote`

#### **Key Benefits of Remote Functions:**

1. **Type-safe**: Input validation with Zod schemas
2. **Bypass Support**: Automatically handles `payments_bypass` flag for testing
3. **Server-side Validation**: Never trusts client-provided amounts
4. **Audit Trail**: Maintains RLS and audit trails through server-side operations
5. **Idempotency**: Safe retries with proper error handling

### 3. **Payment Remote Functions Already Handle Both Flows**

The payment remote functions (`src/lib/server/remotes/payments.remote.ts`) automatically:

#### **Standard Payment Flow (PayMongo)**:

- Validates organization payment settings
- Creates PayMongo checkout session
- Records pending payment in database
- Returns checkout URL for redirect

#### **Bypass Flow (Testing/Development)**:

- Checks for `payments_bypass` flag in org settings
- Calls server-side bypass helpers:
  - `addCreditsBypass()` from `$lib/server/credits/bypass-helpers.ts`
  - `grantFeatureBypass()` from `$lib/server/credits/bypass-helpers.ts`
- Immediately grants credits/features server-side
- Creates audit transaction records
- Returns success URL

### 4. **Manual Credits/Bypass Purchases Use Server-Side Functions**

#### **Credit Bypass Helper Functions (`src/lib/server/credits/bypass-helpers.ts`)**:

- `addCreditsBypass()` - Server-only credit addition with RLS
- `grantFeatureBypass()` - Server-only feature granting with RLS
- `generateBypassReference()` - Generate audit reference IDs

#### **These functions**:

- Use `supabaseAdmin` for server-side database access
- Maintain RLS (Row Level Security) compliance
- Create proper audit transaction records
- Validate against server-side catalog (never trust client)

## Verification

### ✅ **Existing Credit System Intact**

- No modifications to client-side credit utilities
- All existing credit checking/usage logic preserved
- Database operations still use proper RLS

### ✅ **Purchase UI Uses Remote Functions**

- Pricing page now calls `createCreditPayment()` and `createFeaturePayment()`
- Account page routes through pricing page (no direct purchase calls)
- All purchase flows go through server-side remote functions

### ✅ **Manual/Bypass Operations Server-Side Only**

- Credit additions use `addCreditsBypass()` (server-only)
- Feature grants use `grantFeatureBypass()` (server-only)
- Proper audit trails maintained with RLS compliance

### ✅ **Payment Processing Architecture**

```
Client (Purchase UI)
    ↓ calls
Payment Remote Functions (Server)
    ↓ either
┌─ PayMongo Integration ──── OR ──── Bypass Helpers (Server) ─┐
│                                                           │
└── Both create audit records and preserve RLS compliance ──┘
```

## Files Modified

1. `src/routes/pricing/+page.svelte` - Updated to use payment remote functions

## Files Preserved (Untouched)

1. `src/lib/utils/credits.ts` - **NO CHANGES** (as required)
2. `src/lib/server/credits/bypass-helpers.ts` - Already exists for manual/bypass operations
3. `src/lib/server/remotes/payments.remote.ts` - Already handles both PayMongo and bypass flows

## Result

✅ **Task Complete**: The existing credit system remains fully intact while all purchase UI now properly routes through the payment remote functions, which handle both standard PayMongo payments and bypass scenarios while preserving RLS and audit trails.
