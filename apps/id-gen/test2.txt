Digital Dreams

In silicon valleys where data flows,
A coder's heart forever glows,
Through midnight hours and morning dew,
Building worlds both old and new.

Arrays and objects dance in space,
While algorithms find their place,
Each function call a whispered prayer,
That bugs will vanish into air.

The terminal window, dark and deep,
Where secrets of the system sleep,
Green text scrolling, line by line,
Making digital dreams align.

So here's to git and version control,
To commits that make our projects whole,
May your pushes always succeed,
And your code fulfill every need.
