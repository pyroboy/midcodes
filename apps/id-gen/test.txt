Lines of Code

In the quiet of the morning light,
Where keyboards click and screens glow bright,
A developer sits with coffee near,
Writing code that will persevere.

Functions flow like gentle streams,
Variables hold our wildest dreams,
While loops dance in endless time,
Making logic fall in rhyme.

Bugs may hide in shadows deep,
But we debug while others sleep,
Each commit a step ahead,
Following where our passion led.

So here's to code that builds and grows,
To git push when the moment shows,
May your branches merge with ease,
And your deployments bring you peace.
